st.markdown("""Here, we utilise a :red[Chain-of-Thought (CoT)] prompting framework that allows us to make our LLM reason through its response before returning an output.
As outlined in the landmark paper on CoT prompting ([Wei et. al., Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903)), CoT prompting allows LLMs to looks at a few examples (i.e. few-shot prompting) and the thought process behind them. The paper studies several LLMs on several different models such as PaLM and LaMDA, as well as GPT-3
In the paper above, CoT prompting serves to:
    - Diagnose (pun intended) and debug any visual hallucinations by asking the model to describe the image.
    - Leverage the autoregressive nature of LLMs like GPT-4o to look at both the image context and the generated text description of the image before generating its own diagnosis
    - Provide us with a means to seed possible areas for the models to look at (e.g. provide examples looking out for certain characteristics/telltale features of )
CoT prompting was used as follows:
