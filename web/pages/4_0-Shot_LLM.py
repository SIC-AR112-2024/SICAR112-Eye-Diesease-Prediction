st.write("LLMs are a form of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) model that comprehends and generates language text that can be comprehended by a human. They are used in almost if not all GenAI Chatbots that dominate school life, including ChatGPT by OpenAI and Google's Gemini AI.")
st.write("Recent advances in LLM technology has allowed some LLMs to have vision capabilities, hence they are able to receive image inputs, interpret these images and output understandable text about the image.")
st.write("This ability to describe the image beyond just classification gives it a clear advantage over traditional CNNs we have discussed earlier, as explanability is very important in applying it to medicine")
st.subheader("About Zero-shot learning")
st.write("Zero-shot learning refers to the model being given images not shown during training and classifying them. In this case, we used a LLM model with vision capabilities, and gave it a small testing dataset of retinal fundus images to gauge its proficiency in diagnosing the diseases.")
st.write("The models we tried using were Chatgpt-4o and Gemini, although we eventually settled on the former. In the prompt, the model was instructed to only respond with the name of the disease for easy validation.")
st.subheader("Limitations of Zero-shot learning")
st.write("Due to the lack of exposure to the images and insufficient knowledge/training on the subject matter, the machine is prone to misinterpreting the image or failing to pick up on finer details of the image and giving an incorrect diagnosis. Hence its accuracy in the classification of the diseases fell short of the CNNs as seen in the previous section.")
st.write("As the machine does not have a reference prompt template, the machine may not generate the prompt in the format desired by the user, which may pose problems in explainability.")
